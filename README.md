Deep Reinforcement Learning: REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, & PPO

This repository contains PyTorch implementations of three foundational to state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, built using OpenAI Gymnasium.
The project progresses from Vanilla Policy Gradients to Actor-Critic methods, and finally to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

# 📌 Algorithms Implemented

REINFORCE (Vanilla Policy Gradient)

Actor-Critic with GAE

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
