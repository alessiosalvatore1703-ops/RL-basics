Deep Reinforcement Learning: REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, & PPO
This repository contains implementations of three core Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms using PyTorch and OpenAI Gymnasium, progressing from foundational policy gradients to state-of-the-art PPO.
📂 Project Overview
1. week1_homework_exercises.ipynb (REINFORCE)Implements the foundational REINFORCE (Vanilla Policy Gradient) algorithm.Core Logic: Monte Carlo policy updates using rewards-to-go.Key Functions: discounted_return for cumulative rewards and compute_loss for the standard policy gradient loss.Goal: Solves tasks like LunarLander-v3 by directly optimizing policy parameters.2. week2_in_class_exercise1.ipynb (Actor-Critic)Upgrades REINFORCE by adding a value function critic to reduce variance.Core Logic: Two networks (Actor & Critic) and Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE).Key Functions: compute_gae balances bias-variance, and train_one_epoch now collects next_obs for TD-learning.Improvement: Uses advantages ($A = Q - V$) instead of raw returns to stabilize training.3. week2_in_class_exercise2 (2).ipynb (PPO)Implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for robust and sample-efficient learning.Core Logic: Uses a Clipped Surrogate Objective to prevent destructive policy updates.Key Features: Trains on the same data for multiple epochs using shuffled mini-batches.Regularization: Includes entropy bonuses to encourage exploration.
